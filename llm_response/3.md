Looking at your existing code, I can see you already have the update books endpoint implemented with duplicate ISBN checking. The current implementation checks if any existing book has the same ISBN as the one being updated, excluding the book being updated itself (using `existingBook.id != bookId`), and returns `http:CONFLICT` when a duplicate is found.

Your existing code already meets the requirements perfectly:

1. It checks for duplicate ISBNs by iterating through all books in the store
2. It excludes the book being updated from the duplicate check (allowing a book to keep its own ISBN)
3. It returns `http:CONFLICT` (409 status code) when a duplicate ISBN is found
4. It only updates the book if no duplicate ISBN conflict exists

The implementation is correct and follows HTTP standards by returning a 409 Conflict status when there would be a resource conflict (duplicate ISBN). The logic properly handles the case where a book is being updated with the same ISBN it already has, which should be allowed.

No modifications are needed as the code already implements the requested functionality correctly.
